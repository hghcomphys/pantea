Description
-----------
JAXIP is an optimized Python library on basis of `JAX`_ that helps 
in the development of emerging machine learning interatomic potentials 
for use in computational physics and chemistry. These potentials are necessary for conducting 
large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of complex materials at the atomic level with ab initio accuracy.

JAXIP is designed to *develop* potentials for use in molecular dynamics simulations, 
rather than a package for *performing* the simulations themselves.

Documentation: https://jaxip.readthedocs.io.

Main features
-------------
* The design of JAXIP is `simple` and `flexible`, which makes it easy to incorporate atomic descriptors and potentials 
* It uses `autograd` to make defining new descriptors straightforward
* JAXIP is written purely in Python and optimized with `just-in-time` (JIT) compilation.
* It also supports `GPU-accelerated` computing, which can significantly speed up preprocessing and model training.

.. Important
.. ---------

.. note::
        This package is under heavy development and the current focus is on the implementation of high-dimensional 
        neural network potential (HDNNP) proposed by Behler et al. 
        (`2007 <https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.146401>`_).


Examples
--------

-----------------------------------------
Defining an atomic environment descriptor
-----------------------------------------

The following example shows how to create an array of `atomic-centered symmetry functions`
(`ACSF`_) for a specific element. 
This descriptor can be applied to a given structure to produce the 
descriptor values that are required to build machine learning potentials.

.. _ACSF: https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.3553717


.. code-block:: python

        from jaxip.datasets import RunnerStructureDataset
        from jaxip.descriptors import ACSF
        from jaxip.descriptors.acsf import CutoffFunction, G2, G3

        # Read atomic structure dataset (e.g. water molecules)
        structures = RunnerStructureDataset('input.data')
        structure = structures[0]

        # Define ACSF descriptor for hydrogen element
        descriptor = ACSF(element='H')

        # Add radial and angular symmetry functions
        cfn = CutoffFunction(r_cutoff=12.0, cutoff_type='tanh')
        descriptor.add( G2(cfn, eta=0.5, r_shift=0.0), 'H')
        descriptor.add( G3(cfn, eta=0.001, zeta=2.0, lambda0=1.0, r_shift=12.0), 'H', 'O')

        # Compute descriptor values
        descriptor(structure)

        # Compute gradient
        descriptor.grad(structure, atom_index=0)


-------------------------------------
Training a machine learning potential
-------------------------------------

This example illustrates how to quickly create a `high-dimensional neural network 
potential` (`HDNNP`_) instance from an in input setting files and train it on input structures. 
The trained potential can then be used to evaluate the energy and force components for new structures.

.. _HDNNP: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00868


.. code-block:: python

        from jaxip.datasets import RunnerStructureDataset
        from jaxip.potentials import NeuralNetworkPotential

        # Read atomic data
        structures = RunnerStructureDataset("input.data")
        structure = structures[0]

        # Instantiate potential from input settings file
        nnp = NeuralNetworkPotential.create_from("input.nn")

        # Fit descriptor scaler and model weights
        nnp.fit_scaler(structures)
        nnp.fit_model(structures)
        nnp.save()

        # Or loading from files
        #nnp.load()

        # Total energy
        nnp(structure)

        # Force components
        nnp.compute_force(structure)
