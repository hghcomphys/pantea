Jaxip - JAX-based Interatomic Potential
=======================================

Jaxip is an optimized Python library on basis of Google JAX that enables development of machine
learning inter-atomic potentials for use in computational physics and material science.
These potentials are necessary for conducting large-scale molecular dynamics simulations
of complex materials with ab initio accuracy.
